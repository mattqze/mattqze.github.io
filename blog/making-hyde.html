<h2>What is Hyde?</h2>
<p><a href='https://github.com/tunnull/jekyll-hyde' target='_blank'>Hyde</a> is a blogging platform based on Jekyll.</h2>
<h2>Why make Hyde?</h2>
<p>I was sick of messing with awful configuration files. In fact, the configuration is so shotty, I broke my Jekyll site in the first 5 minutes of configuration.<br>(Seriously, it's stuck on the default 'Github User' author name.) So I decided to make Jekyll in PHP.<br>Based on Minima, the default theme. Themeing needs work but eventually might be possible.<br> The only problem with Jekyll themes and their conversions to CSS is the fact that Jekyll themes, can re-arrange a site's layout. CSS, on it's own, cannot do this.<br>It can also change naming conventions for elements' classes. No bueno for my rip-off. I'd like to make a naming convention but that goes directly against what Hyde stands for.<br>For now though, all themes are based upon Minima. There's a pretty sick Catppuccin Mocha theme included too.</p>
